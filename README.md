# state-reps-planning
This rep is a playground for me to explore ideas about knowledge representation in the context of developing an AI. Most of these ideas are obtained/inspired by Rich Sutton's reinforcement learning class and text. 

Incomplete list of ideas explored:
- General Value Functions
- Predictive State Representations
- Generating features that are tested and thrown away according to how useful they are in achieving reward
- Adaptive step-sizes per feature that are updated through some gradient descent rule
